# I Built a Zero-Build Blog: Just Markdown and git push

![A zero-build Markdown blog rendered directly by the browser](cover.png)

## Intro

Every "simple" blog I tried wanted the same thing from me first: install a static-site generator, learn its templating language, run a build, then babysit a deploy pipeline. I just wanted to **write a Markdown file and have it show up online.**

So I built the smallest thing that does exactly that — and nothing else. No Hugo, no Jekyll, no Astro, no `node_modules`, no CI to stare at. You add a folder, you `git push`, and the post is live. This is the blog you're reading right now, and this post is about how it works.

The whole idea fits in one sentence: **the Git repo *is* the website.**

---

## 1. The frustration that started it

A blog is, structurally, almost nothing: a list of posts, and a way to render one. Yet the standard advice turns that into a toolchain — a generator, a theme system, a build command, a deploy action, and a `node_modules` folder heavier than everything you'll ever write.

Every one of those is a thing that can break between you and hitting "publish." I wanted the gap between *I wrote something* and *it's online* to be a single `git push`. Nothing to build, nothing to wait on, nothing to debug at 1 a.m. because a generator bumped a major version.

## 2. The trick: let the browser do the work

Instead of building HTML ahead of time, the site builds itself in the browser, on demand:

```
   write Markdown              git push                 GitHub Pages
  posts/<date>-slug/   ──────────────────►   main   ──────────────────►   index.html + assets/
        index.md                                                                 │
                                                                                 │  in the browser
            ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
            ▼
   list posts (title / date / summary / tags)
   posts/<dir>/index.md ──►  marked + DOMPurify + highlight.js  ──►  rendered article
```

There is no server of mine in this picture. GitHub Pages serves a static `index.html` plus a ~400-line vanilla-JS engine. The engine:

1. **Finds the posts** by reading the repo's `posts/` directory.
2. **Fetches** the chosen post's `index.md` as raw text.
3. **Renders** it client-side with [marked](https://marked.js.org/) (Markdown → HTML), sanitizes the result with [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify), and colors code with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).

Libraries load from a CDN; the app shell caches like an installed app. That's the entire architecture. The "database" is the folder tree.

## 3. What you get for free

Because the post list is derived, not hand-maintained, a lot of housekeeping just disappears:

- 🗂 **Auto index** — drop a post folder, it appears on the home page, newest first. No list to edit.
- 🔗 **Auto prev/next** — inter-post navigation is generated from the post order.
- 🖼 **Relative images** — write `images/diagram.png` and the engine resolves it *per post*, so two posts can both have an `images/cover.png` without colliding.
- 💬 **Comments** — GitHub Discussions via [Giscus](https://giscus.app), no third-party tracker.
- 🌓 **Dark mode** that follows the system theme, and light/dark-aware syntax highlighting.

Writing a post is just:

```
posts/
└─ 2026-06-26-zero-build-blog/
   ├─ index.md      # frontmatter + body
   └─ images/       # referenced as images/x.png
```

```markdown
---
title: My Post
date: 2026-06-26
summary: One line shown on the home-page card.
tags: [blog, vanilla-js]
---

The body starts here…
```

Push it. Done.

## 4. The one pit I fell into: the GitHub API rate limit

The first version was even purer: it listed posts live through the **anonymous GitHub Contents API** at page load. Beautiful in theory — zero stored state, the directory listing was always the source of truth.

Then the home page started returning **403** for some visitors.

The anonymous GitHub API is rate-limited to **60 requests per hour per IP**. On shared or carrier-grade-NAT networks (and to anyone who refreshed a few times), that budget evaporates, and the listing call fails. A blog whose home page sometimes just doesn't load is not a blog.

The fix keeps the "repo is the source of truth" spirit without paying the API tax on every page view: a tiny zero-dependency script, [`scripts/gen-posts.mjs`](https://github.com/ZerbLion/zrxl_blog/blob/main/scripts/gen-posts.mjs), scans every `posts/<slug>/index.md`, parses its frontmatter, and writes a static `posts.json`. The engine reads that file first — no API call, no rate limit, no 403.

And to keep the author's promise intact ("just push"), a GitHub Actions workflow runs that script on every push and commits the regenerated `posts.json`. So the index is still derived from the posts — the derivation just moved from *the visitor's browser, every time* to *CI, once per push*. The frontmatter parser in the script is deliberately identical to the one in the client engine, so what CI indexes and what the browser renders can never drift apart.

## 5. Bilingual without a framework

Each post can ship two files: `index.md` (English, the default) and `index.zh.md` (Chinese). Frontmatter declares the relationship:

```markdown
lang: en
translations: [zh]
```

The engine sees `translations` and shows a language toggle; clicking it swaps to `index.zh.md`. No i18n library, no routing config — two files and two lines of frontmatter.

## 6. Honest trade-offs

This approach is deliberately narrow, and it's worth being clear about the costs:

- **The repo must be public.** The engine (and the no-build ethos) assumes anyone can fetch the raw Markdown. Private blogging is not what this is for.
- **Rendering is client-side.** First paint waits on JS + CDN libraries. For a text blog this is imperceptible; for a latency-critical or SEO-maximalist site, prerendering would win.
- **Mainland-China reach** is still on the roadmap — GitHub Pages can be flaky there, so a Cloudflare Pages / self-hosted mirror is the next step.

None of these dent the core win: the distance from *idea* to *published* is one commit.

## 7. Use it yourself

It's MIT-licensed (the engine, not my words). Fork it, point `CONFIG.repo` in `assets/app.js` at your repo, enable GitHub Pages on `main`, and you have a blog where writing a post means writing a file.

If it saves you from spinning up yet another static-site generator, a ⭐ means a lot.
