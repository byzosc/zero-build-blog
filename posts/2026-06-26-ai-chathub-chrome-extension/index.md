summary: A WXT + React 19 MV3 side-panel extension that broadcasts one prompt to several AI panes. The interesting decision was shipping two engines at once — a clean OpenAI-compatible streaming mode and a "webtab" mode that drives your already-logged-in tabs — because each alone isn't enough.

# AI ChatHub: a Multi-AI Side-Panel Extension That Hedges API vs. Tab-Orchestration

![A browser side panel routes one prompt to multiple AI panes](cover.png)

> This is a build write-up of a *skeleton* project I've since paused. I'm publishing it for the architecture decisions, which I think are the interesting part — including one path I implemented and then deliberately made optional. See the honest caveats at the end.

## Intro

I wanted a browser side panel where I type one prompt and several AIs answer it side by side, each in its own pane. Easy to picture; the interesting question is *how each pane talks to its model.* I ended up building two completely different engines into the same extension — and the reason why is the whole story.

The stack: a Manifest V3 extension built with WXT + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind. A side panel with N panes and one input box at the bottom; hit send and it broadcasts to every pane.

---

## 1. Two engines, on purpose

Each pane can run in one of two modes, and you can even mix them — one pane on the API, another on a logged-in web tab:

- **API mode** (the default): POST to an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` with `stream: true`, render tokens as they arrive. Clean, fast, truly streaming. The cost: you need an API key, and you pay per token.
- **webtab mode**: open (or reuse) your already-logged-in ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini tab, inject the prompt into its input box, and read the answer back out of the DOM. The upside: it rides your existing subscription, no API key. The cost: it's fragile, it can't stream token-by-token (it returns the whole reply at once), and — being browser automation of someone else's site — it's against their terms.

Neither alone is satisfying, which is exactly why both exist. API mode is the dependable default; webtab is the "use what you're already paying for" escape hatch, kept behind a setting.

## 2. The MV3 lesson: avoid the Service Worker for long work

Manifest V3 wants your background logic in a Service Worker. But a Service Worker can be **recycled mid-task** by the browser — and an AI generation is exactly the kind of long-running task that gets killed halfway.

So the background script here does precisely one thing: tell Chrome to open the side panel when you click the toolbar icon. That's it. All the orchestration lives in the **side panel page**, which stays alive as long as the panel is open. The panel itself calls `tabs.query` / `tabs.create` and messages content scripts directly. Fighting the platform's lifecycle is a losing game; the fix was to stop putting durable work where the platform feels free to evict it.

Permissions stay deliberately small: `sidePanel`, `storage`, `tabs`, `scripting`, plus a short host allowlist.

## 3. The parts worth keeping

A few pieces I'd reuse in any similar project:

- **One input, N independent contexts.** The broadcast function appends *that pane's own history* before each send, so follow-up questions keep each column on its own thread. Token/done/error events are dispatched by pane index.
- **A 27-line SSE parser.** No SDK — just `ReadableStream` + `TextDecoder({ stream: true })`, splitting on newlines, handling chunks that get cut mid-line, and swallowing non-JSON heartbeats. Because it only assumes OpenAI-compatible SSE, any such endpoint drops in.
- **Injection that survives React.** Writing into a controlled React input by setting `.value` doesn't work — the framework ignores it. You have to use the prototype's value setter *and* dispatch a real `input` event; for a contenteditable like ChatGPT's ProseMirror, use `execCommand('insertText')`, and if that fails, synthesize a paste event. Three fallbacks, because every site's editor is different.
- **Knowing when it's done.** For a streaming web UI, completion is detected in two layers: wait for the stop button to appear and then disappear, then confirm the reply text hasn't changed for ~1 second. Either signal alone is unreliable.

## 4. The honest part (and how it relates to "scraping is dead")

I've written before that aggregating AIs by scraping their web pages is a dead end. This project is the first-hand evidence: webtab mode *is* that dead path, implemented for real. Living inside the code, the fragility is concrete:

- The DOM selectors are, by the project's own note, "extremely prone to breaking on site redesigns — the main long-term maintenance burden." Only the ChatGPT selectors are actually tested; Claude and Gemini are placeholders.
- It's browser automation of a logged-in session, which violates those services' terms and can break or get your account flagged at any time.

So I didn't bet on it. The default is API mode; webtab is an opt-in escape hatch with a warning in the README. That's the difference between this post and the earlier one: that post drew the *conclusion* ("scraping is dead, move to APIs"); this is the *exhibit* — I built the dead path, and the code itself hedges against it.

## 5. Honest trade-offs

- **It's a skeleton, and paused.** It works end to end in API mode, but it's not a finished product.
- **No icons or store assets yet** — the build warns about it; that's a pre-publish chore.
- **webtab has no token streaming**, only ChatGPT is verified, and it's ToS-risky by nature.
- **Claude's native API isn't wired up** — API mode speaks OpenAI-compatible, so Claude would need its own provider.

The keeper isn't the product; it's the shape: two interchangeable engines behind one interface, orchestration kept out of the Service Worker, and a scraping path that the architecture treats as the liability it is.
